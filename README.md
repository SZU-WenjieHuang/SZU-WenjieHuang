  ***Dataset:*** POI Data in Shanghai from Amap.api / 6000 Second-hand-houses data from Lianjia.com / Graphs Data from ArcGis\
  ***Description:*** A summer project at TongJi University supervised by Professor Hao Zheng. Using the API of Amap to collect POI (Points of interests) data of Shanghai, including school, hospital, underground station, bus station ,business and shopping center's location. And the popularity data of second-hand houses from Lianjia website. Trying to use GAN to train an image-to-image mapping to learn the impact of POI data on the popularity of second-hand housing.
  
  
- #### 03 Geometric algorithm: A parameterization model and clusting algorithm for complex facade surfaces (2021.11-2022.1)
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82434538/235367857-67b7efa0-0b40-46a2-a6b3-5c6d01e763fd.png)\
  ***Repository:*** [clusting algorithm for complex facade surfaces](https://github.com/SZU-WenjieHuang/clusting-algorithm-for-complex-facade-surfaces)\
  ***Data:*** The mesh information (vertex position and normal) of complex surfaces after UV mapping\
  ***Description:*** The construction of complex surface of buildings always needs to provide different molds for each panel. I hope to find the optimal pannel clusting through K-means clustering, so the same mold can correspond to different pannels, save costs in the actual construction process. Before clusting, I constructed a parameterized model for panels, using 5 parameters to difine the size and curvature of each pannel. I divied all panels into three categories: flat, single curved surface, and hyperbilic surface in first round. Then, clusting was performed within each catagory.

  ***Data:*** Video in Shekou Fishing Market\
  ***Description:*** Shekou Fishing Market will be demolished by the end of November 2020. With the HiLens Kit by HUAWEI Cloud, we built an installation in the sea world culture and arts center(SWCAC) to continue Shekou people's memory of Shekou fishing Market. We collect video in market using HiLens Kit's camera, and use YOLO_v3 algorithm to carry out human shape detextion in real time. Through stepping motors and other devices, we convey the same sense of crowding to exhibitors as in Shekou market. And the sense of crowding will also be preserved in the form of data.

- #### 01 Piccolo Game Engine (2022.12-now)
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82434538/235370947-309b4b8d-f9e6-49f0-919e-85ab6ba9697f.png)
  ***Repository:*** [Piccolo Game Engine](https://github.com/SZU-WenjieHuang/Piccolo-GameEnging)\
  ***Course Website:*** [Games104](https://www.youtube.com/@piccoloengine)\
  ***Description:*** I'm following a course ([Games104](https://games104.boomingtech.com/sc/))building a mini-game engine, from the engine layers to the reflection system, rendering system, and collision system. This is very challenging and long work, but I believe it will give me a deeper understanding of the game engine. rom the Core engine layer, such as the rendering engine, physics engine, audio engine, and input system, These systems handle low-level tasks such as rendering graphics, simulating physics, playing sounds, and handling user input.


- #### 02 Animation using Unreal Engine and Houdini (2022.09-2022.10)

  ***Top100 Works*** [Top100 Moving Meditations Works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8b5k0M8wTBg&t=23s)\
  ***Description:*** I took part in the ["Moving Meditations" CG animation challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0OvHVJV_XU&t=60s) on YouTube in 2022. I modeled my creation using Maya, then set up the environment and camera in Unreal Engine. I touched up the object's UV and material using 3ds Maxs and brought my character to life by rigging its bones in Blender. Finally, I added some effects like fog, clouds, and a rainy effect using bluePrint in Unreal Engine before rendering it all into a sequence.


- #### 03 Tiny Renderer (2022.06-2022.08)
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82434538/235371020-def9d366-6221-438d-a78d-577447dbfdf6.png)

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82434538/235371055-32570506-ae6c-4ebd-93d1-775515fd5ccc.png)
  ***Repository:***  [Ray Tracing](https://github.com/SZU-WenjieHuang/RayTracing)\
  ***Course Website (Wiki):*** [Ray Tracing in one weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)\
  ***Description:*** Ray tracing is a technique used in computer graphics to generate highly realistic images by simulating the behavior of light in a scene. The technique involves tracing the path of light rays, and calculating how they are reflected, or absorbed by different materials.In a typical ray tracing algorithm, a virtual camera is placed in the scene, and rays are cast from the camera into the scene to see what objects and surfaces are visible. Followed the [wiki](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html), I build a RayTracing from the most basic intersection algorithm of rays and geometric objects using Monte Carlo Methods.


- #### 05 Unity Shader (2022.01-2022.05)
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82434538/235371077-5d5a485b-3245-4404-b8a7-de62c3729450.png)
  ***Repository:*** [Unity Shader](https://github.com/SZU-WenjieHuang/UnityShader)\
  ***Description:*** Unity allows developers to control how light interacts with objects, how textures are applied to surfaces, and how materials behave. Shaders can be customized and combined to create unique visual effects and styles in a game or application. We can Implement smoke effect and transparency by customizing the vertex shader and fragment shader in the rendering pipeline throung Unity shader, to achieve the desired effect. I programme lighting equations and sample colors on texture mapping to implement rendering algorithms for both realism and non-realism effects.


- #### 06 Realtime Rendering Algorithm in WebGL (2022.09-2022.20)
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82434538/235371123-02974423-62b5-458d-8759-f75a7b4b5d2d.png)
  ***Repository:*** [Realtime Rendering](https://github.com/SZU-WenjieHuang/Games202-RealtimeRendering)\
  ***Competition Website:*** [Games202 by ucsb](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~lingqi/teaching/games202.html)\
  ***Description:*** In the Online courses by UC Santa Barbara, I have achieved many real-time rendering algorithms in the framework of WebGL. For example here is a PCSS Soft shadow, It works by taking into account the size and shape of the light source, as well as the distance and angle between the light source and the object casting the shadow, to create soft and realistic shadow edges.


- #### 07 AR Application in Andriod and IOS (2022.12-2023.01)
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82434538/235371164-8b1be4ab-5726-492f-bbd1-ec467e0b1523.png)
  ***Repository:*** [AR Application(IOS)](https://github.com/SZU-WenjieHuang/AR)\
  ***Framework:*** [Unity AR Foundation](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/arfoundation-samples)\
  ***Description:*** I was really impressed by the amazing effect of Microsoft Mesh and HoloLens. Unfortunately, I don't have a HoloLens yet, so I couldn't develop interactive mixed reality yet. Instead,I tried to deploy the AR model separately on Android and iOS. </p>
On Android, we have the option to choose between ARCore and Vuforia as our AR development platforms. Both platforms support device tracking, plane detection, face tracking, and 2D/3D object tracking. However, since ARCore does not support every Android device yet, I chose to use Vuforia for my project on Android. I deployed a 2D image tracking feature and added an animation of a model to the target image. </p>
On IOS, I choose AR Foundation. It can support both ARKit and ARCore. AR Foundation has many Subsystems, such as XRSession, XRCamera, and Also XRImage. I deployed the most basic Devices Tracking on my ipad and can be found that if we need a better positioning effect, we still need to add 2D/3D Tracking.


- #### 08 PacMan game implemented with SFML(2023.02-2023.03)
  ***Repository:*** [Pacman](https://github.com/SZU-WenjieHuang/PacMan)\
  ***Description:*** I have developed a PacMan games using the SFML library. The game is set in maze where the player controls PacMan to eat all the pellets while avoiding the ghosts. The game features classic gameplay mechanics, such as power pellets that allow PacMan to eat the ghosts and bonus fruits tha appear in the maze. The graphics and sounds are designed to recreate the nostalgia of the original game, making it a fun and engaging experience for player.

  ***Repository:*** [MiniGames](https://github.com/SZU-WenjieHuang/Unreal-Engine-Mini-Games)\
  ***Description:*** I've created a few small games using Unreal Engine, relying on its blueprint system for development. This includes designing the interface UI, working with materials, rigging characters with bones, creating animations, and adding sound effects, and particle systems.
