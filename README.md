### Deep Learning / Machine Learning Projects

- #### 01 Kaggle Shopee Price Matching Multimodal Project (2021.3-2021.5)

  ***Repository:*** [Solution for shopee-product-matching](https://github.com/SZU-WenjieHuang/Kaggle-Shopee-Price-Matching-Multimodal-Project)\
  ***Competition Website:*** [Kaggle Shopee Price Matching Multimodal Project](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/shopee-product-matching)\
  ***Dataset:*** [35000(Trianing set)+7000(Test set) products in Shopee with image / image_phash / title / id / label](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/shopee-product-matching/data)\
  ***Description:*** Developed a model recommend similar products to customers through image and text model. (CV+NLP)Used multiple image and text models to train a significant amount of data. And a voting method for Post-processing.


- #### 02 UrbanGAN: A GAN based model for predicting the popularity of second-hand housing (2021.8-2021.10)

  ***Repository:*** [UrbanGAN](https://github.com/SZU-WenjieHuang/UrbanGAN)\
  ***Dataset:*** POI Data in Shanghai from Amap.api / 6000 Second-hand-houses data from Lianjia.com / Graphs Data from ArcGis\
  ***Description:*** A summer project at TongJi University supervised by Professor Hao Zheng. Using the API of Amap to collect POI (Points of interests) data of Shanghai, including school, hospital, underground station, bus station ,business and shopping center's location. And the popularity data of second-hand houses from Lianjia website. Trying to use GAN to train an image-to-image mapping to learn the impact of POI data on the popularity of second-hand housing.
  
  
- #### 03 Geometric algorithm: A parameterization model and clusting algorithm for complex facade surfaces (2021.11-2022.1)
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82434538/235356112-fe521fc3-5df4-498e-b01b-43597a96422b.png)
  ***Repository:*** [clusting algorithm for complex facade surfaces](https://github.com/SZU-WenjieHuang/clusting-algorithm-for-complex-facade-surfaces)\
  ***Data:*** The mesh information (vertex position and normal) of complex surfaces after UV mapping\
  ***Description:*** The construction of complex surface of buildings always needs to provide different molds for each panel. I hope to find the optimal pannel clusting through K-means clustering, so the same mold can correspond to different pannels, save costs in the actual construction process. Before clusting, I constructed a parameterized model for panels, using 5 parameters to difine the size and curvature of each pannel. I divied all panels into three categories: flat, single curved surface, and hyperbilic surface in first round. Then, clusting was performed within each catagory.
 
 
- #### 04 HUAWEI Cloud AI Competition: Recording disappearing cultural heritage using YOLO_v3 (2020.10-2020.12)
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82434538/235357499-9ca79e72-b45b-4eaf-8e6b-3266b1c1d1a8.png)
  ***Repository:*** [YOLOv3-Shekou-FishingMarket](https://github.com/SZU-WenjieHuang/YOLOv3-ShekouMarket)\
  ***Data:*** Video in Shekou Fishing Market\
  ***Description:*** Shekou Fishing Market will be demolished by the end of November 2020. With the HiLens Kit by HUAWEI Cloud, we built an installation in the sea world culture and arts center(SWCAC) to continue Shekou people's memory of Shekou fishing Market. We collect video in market using HiLens Kit's camera, and use YOLO_v3 algorithm to carry out human shape detextion in real time. Through stepping motors and other devices, we convey the same sense of crowding to exhibitors as in Shekou market. And the sense of crowding will also be preserved in the form of data.
